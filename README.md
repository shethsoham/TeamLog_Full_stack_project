Description about the project: 

Iâ€™ve built TeamLog, a full-stack CRUD application designed to manage staff data effectively. The application allows users to easily create, read, update, and delete employee profiles, which include essential information such as names, contact details, work locations, and more. With a clean, responsive design, TeamLog is built as a single-page application (SPA), ensuring seamless navigation and a smooth user experience across all devices.

To build TeamLog, I used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for a clean, responsive interface. Leveraging ES6 JavaScript concepts like async/await and promises, I handled asynchronous programming to keep the app user-friendly and responsive. React and React Router were used for efficient, component-based navigation, with MongoDB Atlas as the NoSQL database. The backend, developed using Node.js and Express.js, handles server-side operations effectively. I tested and optimized API requests with Postman and used Git, GitHub, and GitLab for version control. For deployment, the frontend is hosted on Netlify and the backend on Render.com.

*Technologies Used:* HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript (ES6), React, React Router, MongoDB Atlas, Node.js, Express.js, Postman, Git, GitHub, GitLab, Netlify, Render.com, Visual Studio Code, FontAwesome
